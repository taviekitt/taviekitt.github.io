I have a research presentation on the 28th!

This week I worked on further debugging the multi-robot DR-PRM code (It's a knot of errors. Nothing seems to be generating correctly). However, I took a break from that to run a small batch of experiments on DR-PRM with CBS for the research poster.

Most of the multi-robot DR-PRM experiments took forever and then never finished generating paths. I think I will have to reorganize my research poster to display the differences in Vizmo (simulation) roadmaps to show the benefits of DR-PRM, and then explain why DR-PRM still needs work for multiple robots.

I'll redo my poster and then print it tomorrow.
