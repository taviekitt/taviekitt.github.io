title: Week 6

This week I worked on the Bridge Test sampler for open sourcing. I added code for group robots, as well as tests, and got everything to compile, run, and pass tests. The biggest challenges was that the group roadmap wasn't generating and was causing segmentation faults. The group roadmap generation is not explicitly called in the Bridge Test. It's handled by layers of inhertance (the dreaded diamond, even) so Courtney helped me for several hours and then James worked with us. We ultimately solved the problem. I'm not cleaning up the push request by removing debugging code and making nicer documentation. 

I'm also working on a poster to present to the summer computer science research group. I think I might be presenting the outline of my poster tomorrow.
