I can't believe my time at Parasol is over!

I'm a bit disappointed that I won't get to finished debugging DR-PRM. After the last week of continuing to play wack-a-mole with segmentation faults linked to inheritance calls, I feel like I've made real progress and whoever comes after me should have fewer big structural changes to make. If I've learned anything from working with PMPL, it's how software development truly is a team sport. Hopefully, the time I spent commenting the DR-PRM multi-robot code aids my successor.

I feel like I've learned so much over the last months. It was wonderfuly gaining familiarity with C++ and large code bases, but I think the more valuable experience has been understanding how research institutions work. Coming from a small liberal arts college of 2,000 people, I had no idea how research was made, how labs were organized, or how much labor was behind a single novel algorithm. It's inspiring. I feel like my understanding of my future options has been infinitely broadened.
